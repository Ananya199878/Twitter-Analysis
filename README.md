# Twitter-Analysis
The Real time Twitter Analytics Dashboard project developed using Power BI designed to analyze and visualize Twitter data. The dashboard provides real-time insights into key metrics such as user engagement rate , tweet trends and Impressions.

# Task 
1.  Develop a chart that displays tweets with the highest engagement rates (top 10%). Include only those tweets that have received more than 50 likes and were posted on weekdays and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself as well as tweet character count should be below 30.
2.  Build a chart to identify the top 10 tweets by the sum of retweets and likes. Filter out tweets posted on weekends and show the user profile that posted each tweet and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet impression should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet word count be below 30
3.  Create a line chart showing the trend of the average engagement rate over each month of the year. Separate the lines for tweets with media content and those without and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST and 7 AM to 11AM apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet engagement should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet character count should be above 20 and need to remove tweet word which has letter 'C'.
